[TAIA base] I'm your Telco AI Assistant. What can I do for you?

```bash
[Human] > Can you deploy for me 5g user plane?
```

```bash
[TAIA base] To deploy the 5G User Plane, I need to know the specific vendor for the Network Function (NF). The available vendors are OAI, Nokia, and Free5GC. Could you please specify which vendor's User Plane Function (UPF) you would like to deploy?
```

```bash
[Human] > deploy free5gc
```

```bash
Invoking: `get_upstream_repo` with `{'nf_type': '5g-core', 'nf_vendor': 'free5gc'}`
responded: Great choice! I will proceed with deploying the 5G User Plane Function (UPF) from Free5GC. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. Retrieve the URL of the upstream repository for the 5G Core from Free5GC.
2. Clone the Git repository containing the necessary helm charts.
3. Deploy the UPF using the appropriate helm chart from the cloned repository.

Let's start by getting the URL of the upstream repository for the 5G Core from Free5GC.

[Info] Found repository, type[5g-core], vendor[free5gc]: https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git
(True, 'https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git')
```

```bash
Invoking: `clone_git_repo` with `{'nf_vendor': 'free5gc', 'upstream_repo': 'https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git'}`
responded: I have successfully retrieved the URL of the upstream repository for the 5G Core from Free5GC. The next step is to clone this repository.

I will now proceed to clone the Git repository from the provided URL.
