[Human] > Can you deploy for me 5g control plane from free5gc?
```

```bash
Invoking: `get_upstream_repo` with `{'nf_type': '5g-core', 'nf_vendor': 'free5gc'}`
responded: To deploy the 5G control plane from free5GC, I will need to perform the following steps:

1. **Get the URL of the Upstream Repository**: I will retrieve the URL for the free5GC repository that contains the necessary helm charts for the 5G core network functions.
2. **Clone the Git Repository**: Using the URL obtained, I will clone the repository to access the helm charts.
3. **Deploy the Network Functions**: I will deploy the necessary network functions for the 5G control plane, which typically include the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function), SMF (Session Management Function), and possibly others like PCF (Policy Control Function) and UDM (Unified Data Management).

Let's start with the first step. I will get the URL for the free5GC repository containing the 5G core network functions.

[Info] Found repository, type[5g-core], vendor[free5gc]: https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git
(True, 'https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git')

[TAIA base] The deployment of the 5G control plane network functions from free5GC has been successfully completed. The following functions have been deployed:

- **AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function)**
- **SMF (Session Management Function)**
- **PCF (Policy Control Function)**

```bash
[Human] > This is not complete control plane, please deploy all. Also include webui
```

```bash
responded: To deploy the complete 5G control plane from free5GC, including all network functions and the web user interface, I will proceed with the following steps:

1. **Deploy additional Network Functions**: I will deploy any remaining network functions that are part of the 5G control plane which have not been deployed yet.
2. **Deploy the WebUI**: This will provide a graphical interface to manage the network functions.

Let's start by deploying the remaining network functions and the WebUI. Please hold on while I complete these deployments.

```bash
[Human] > Now deploy for me user plane
```

```bash
responded: To deploy the 5G user plane from free5GC, I will need to deploy the UPF (User Plane Function). This function is responsible for handling user data traffic within the 5G network.

I will proceed with the following steps:

1. **Deploy the UPF**: This involves deploying the helm chart for the UPF component.

Please hold on while I complete the deployment of the UPF.

Invoking: `deploy_nf` with `{'nf_name': 'UPF', 'nf_helm_chart_name': 'free5gc-upf', 'local_repo_path': '/home/pmq/workshop/python-programming/taia/base/cloned-repos/free5gc'}`
```

```bash
[TAIA base] It seems there was an issue with the deployment of the UPF (User Plane Function). The specified helm chart for the UPF does not exist in the repository.

To proceed, I will need to identify the correct helm chart name for the UPF within the cloned repository. Let me check the available helm charts and select the appropriate one for the UPF deployment.
The available helm charts for the UPF in the free5GC repository are:

- **free5gc-upf-11**
- **free5gc-upf-21**
- **free5gc-upf-31**
- **free5gc-upf-c**

Please specify which version of the UPF you would like to deploy, or if you want me to deploy all available versions.
```

```bash
[Human] > all of them, thanks

```

```bash
[TAIA base] All versions of the UPF (User Plane Function) have been successfully deployed from the free5GC repository. Here are the details:
