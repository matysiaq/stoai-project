[Human] > Can you deploy for me 5g core from Nokia?
```

```bash
Invoking: `get_upstream_repo` with `{'nf_type': '5g-core', 'nf_vendor': 'nokia'}`
responded: To deploy the 5G Core from Nokia, I will need to follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the URL of the upstream repository for the Nokia 5G Core.
2. Clone the Git repository containing the necessary Network Functions (NFs) and their Helm charts.
3. Deploy the individual Network Functions to the Kubernetes cluster.

Let's start with the first step. I will get the URL of the upstream repository for the Nokia 5G Core. Please hold on for a moment.

(False, "Couldn't find the repository for [5g-core, nokia]")It seems there was an issue retrieving the repository for the Nokia 5G Core. This could be due to various reasons such as access restrictions or incorrect vendor/type specification.

To proceed, I can attempt to retrieve the repository using different parameters or check for any specific requirements or corrections needed. Would you like me to try again or check for any specific details?

[Human] > You are right, Nokia core is not available. Please deploy free5gc instead.
```

```bash
Invoking: `get_upstream_repo` with `{'nf_type': '5g-core', 'nf_vendor': 'free5gc'}`
responded: To deploy the 5G Core using free5GC, I will follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the URL of the upstream repository for the free5GC 5G Core.
2. Clone the Git repository containing the necessary Network Functions (NFs) and their Helm charts.
3. Deploy the individual Network Functions to the Kubernetes cluster.

Let's start with the first step. I will get the URL of the upstream repository for the free5GC 5G Core. Please hold on for a moment.

[Info] Found repository, type[5g-core], vendor[free5gc]: https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git
(True, 'https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git')
Invoking: `clone_git_repo` with `{'nf_vendor': 'free5gc', 'upstream_repo': 'https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git'}`
responded: I have successfully retrieved the URL for the free5GC 5G Core repository. The next step is to clone this repository.

I will now proceed to clone the Git repository from the URL: `https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git`. Please hold on while I perform this action.
