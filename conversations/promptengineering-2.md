```bash
[TAIA promptengineering] The deployment of the 5G control plane components from free5GC has been successfully completed. Here are the components that were deployed:

- **AMF**
- **SMF**
- **NRF**
- **PCF**
- **AUSF**
- **UDM**
- **UDR**
- **NSSF**
- **WEBUI**

Each component has been deployed using its respective helm chart in the Kubernetes cluster. If you need further assistance or additional deployments, feel free to ask!
```

```bash
[Human] > Now deploy for me user plane
```

```bash
[TAIA promptengineering] To proceed with deploying the user plane, I need to know the vendor for the 5G Network Functions. The available vendors are:

- OAI (OpenAirInterface)
- Nokia
- Free5GC

Please specify the vendor you would like to use for the user plane deployment.
```

```bash
[Human] > Use the same vendor as for control plane
```

```bash
Invoking: `get_upstream_repo` with `{'nf_type': '5g-ran', 'nf_vendor': 'free5gc'}`
```

```bash
[TAIA promptengineering] It seems that there is no available repository for the user plane (5G-RAN) from the vendor free5GC. This might be due to the vendor's focus primarily on the control plane components.

Would you like to explore other vendors for the user plane deployment, or is there anything else I can assist you with?
```

```bash
[Human] > Use free5gc, but you should conside core part of UP
```

```bash
Invoking: `get_upstream_repo` with `{'nf_type': '5g-core', 'nf_vendor': 'free5gc'}`

```bash
[TAIA promptengineering] I have found the upstream repository for free5GC at 'https://github.com/matysiaq/free5gc.git'. May I proceed with cloning this repository for deploying the user plane?
```

```bash
[Human] > skip cloning, you already cloned it to deploy control plane
```

```bash
[TAIA promptengineering] Here are the available helm charts related to the user plane in the cloned repository:
- free5gc-upf-21
- free5gc-upf-11
- free5gc-upf-c
- free5gc-upf-31

Please specify which one you would like to deploy for the user plane.
```

```bash
[Human] > Deploy all of them
```

```bash
Invoking: `deploy_nf` with `{'nf_name': 'UPF', 'nf_helm_chart_name': 'free5gc-upf-21', 'local_repo_path': '/home/pmq/workshop/python-programming/taia/promptengineering/cloned-repos/free5gc'}`

```bash
[Human] > What NFs did you deploy in total?
```

```bash
[TAIA promptengineering] Here is the list of all the Network Functions (NFs) that have been deployed for both the control plane and user plane using the free5GC vendor:

### Control Plane
- **AMF**
